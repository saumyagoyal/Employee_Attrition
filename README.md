EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS

Employee retention is an important problem to businesses. Retaining talented employees is critical to the success of
the firm. Also, replacing employees is costly as companies must incur expenses related to hiring new employees. In
short, employee turnover impacts organizational performance. The data is a fictional set created by IBM, but we will
treat it as real life data. Our project aims to predict employees that are likely to leave. However, in order to produce
more useful insight from our investigation, we attempt to do causal inference and figure out the drivers for this
attrition.
